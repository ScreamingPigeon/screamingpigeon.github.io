## The weekend Before
I don't know where to start for this blog entry. Things have been super hectic and it's been a long time 
since I have written actual words/sentences that aren't meeting notes or homework/lab reports. Well I guess
this blog post will evolve into meeting notes once I get to the actual conference.

Neuroscience 2024, is conveniently happening in Chicago, from 10/5 (i think) to 10/9. I am going to be there
on 10/7 and 10/8. This is my first time going to an actual conference - so I was nervous at first. But after
seeing the itinerary and the kind of cool things people are doing, I am pretty hyped up now.

And I really need a change of scenery. After how busy the last 3 weeks have been with work and school, I am treating
this little excursion as a mini-vacation of sorts.
