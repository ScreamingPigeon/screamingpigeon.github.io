This is going to be a follow-up to my last post. I realized that the topic
was going to be to big too cover (and also write) in one sitting. In the last 
[blog post](https://screamingpigeon.github.io/projects/ooo_pt1/), I go over
the general premise of out-of-order processors. In this post, I will try to share 
my experience designing and verifying such a CPU, and reflect on the challenges and
rationalization of certain design choices.
