These are some of the things I've worked on:


##### Papers
- *"Tai Chi Practice Buffers Aging Effects in Functional Brain Connectivity"*, MDPI Brain Sciences Journal (SI AI applications in Neuroimaging) 2024 ([article](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/14/9/901))


##### Conferences
- *"Neural Reorganization Through Repetition"*, IEEE Neural Engineering Research 2025 (*Neuroscience and AI*, *Neural signal processing*) 
- *"Food-waste derived triboelectric sensors for biomechanical monitoring of frailty status and fall risk in older adults"*, Design of Medical Devices 2025 ([paper](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/BIOMED/proceedings/DMD2025/88735/V001T03A008/1218588))
- *"Intelligent square stepping exercise system for cognitive-motor rehabilitation in older adults with multiple sclerosis"*, Design of Medical Devices 2025 ([paper](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/BIOMED/proceedings/DMD2025/88735/V001T03A004/1218623))
- *"Exploring Recurrent Neural Networks in Tai-Chi Practitioners"*, Society for Neuroscience 2024 (Poster Presentation)
- *"Adaptive Graph Thresholding"*, Coordinated Science Laboratory Conference 2024 ([poster](../research/CSLSC_24_poster.pdf)), ([abstract](../research/CSLC_Abstract.pdf))


##### Still in the workshop
And then there are some personal projects that haven't made it out of the figurative garage yet. Some of these are rejected submissions and I'm contemplating making the feedback I received public on this site?:
-  *Evaluating ML models and feature analysis techniques for Physical Activity Recognition in IMU devices*, ([In-Progress](../research/MS_2024_Abstract.pdf))
- *"GSP Techniques to evaluate network dynamics"*, Independent Study, ([Initial Report](../research/396_Final_Project_Report.pdf))
- *"Stressor Identification using EKG Derived Features and ML"*, IEEE BHI Conference 2023 Submission, ([Paper](../research/BHI2023.pdf))
