      <div><h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Last November, I got the chance to meet <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~genkin/">Daniel Genkin</a> - at the <a href="https://www.midwestsecurityworkshop.com/agenda.html">Midwest
Security Workshop</a>. He is one of the authors/discoveres of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">SPECTRE</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)">MELTDOWN</a>
, some of the most critical vulnerabilities discovered in the last decade. These were also unpatchable due to them being
hardware vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Bumping into Daniel was a happy coincidence for me. I was aware that MSW had a section on HW Security (which is why I went in
the first place) - but I never knew that such an epic security researcher was going to be there.</p>
<p>Talking to him was a definitely a cool experience - and I got some solid advice about how to evaluate fields of study for
Graduate School. My main problem with grad school is having one semester to decide on what you want to do - and then
committing to it for the remaining 4.5 years (if not longer). Daniel recommended that I try recreating some of
the cornerstone HW vulnerabilities to get a feel of how much I like the work.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, his perspective of HW sec, particularly that towards exposing vulnerabilities is -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Replicate every single known hardware vulnerability on a new target and collect results. It is highly unlikely
that you will discover something in your first attempt. New hardware is immensenly complicated, proprietary,
and obfuscated. A huge chunk of the work is reverse-engineering the system inside.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Eventually, you will learn bits and pieces about what&rsquo;s inside - and then you can try more specific approaches,
but even then, there is no guarantee of success.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is me paraphrasing, but I feel like it captures the gist of what he said pretty accurately. Coming up with HW
exploits is an extremely iterative process.</p>
<p>Anyways, getting back to why I am writing this. I am going to attempt to describe <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2671225.2671271">Flush + Reload</a>
, an important demonstration of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">Side Channel attacks</a> - and then create
a naive implementation/demo.</p>
<h1 id="flush-reload">Flush Reload</h1>
<p>A few important concepts before we get into how this attack works</p>
<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_paging">Paging</a> is a term you might have heard if you have taken an Operating Systems or Computer
Architecture course in university. Paging operates on the principle of maintaining a &ldquo;logical&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>virtual</strong>&rdquo; map of your memory, that
is mapped to the actual &ldquo;physical&rdquo; memory on your system. Different processes utilize distinct mappings between virtual/logical memory
and physical memory - which is enforced by the kernel. Such a technique offers 3 advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Security: Because processes use different paging schemes, it becomes hard for a malicious process to interfere with other
processes on your system. The ability to manipulate pages is managed by the kernel - and as such - only priveleged contexts
can manipulate pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplicity: Programs no need to allocate physically &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; memory. For example - you need 2GiB of contiguous memory to
allocate an array. With paging - the OS can map blocks of memory at scattered physical addresses to a &ldquo;continous&rdquo; address space
in userspace. This makes writing user programs simple as you no longer need to worry about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing)">memory fragmentation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency: Pages containing memory that is needed by 2 different processes in different address spaces can be remapped and reused. A single physical adddress
can be be mapped to 2 different logical addresses - and reused. Additionally it becomes easy to manage memory consumed by &ldquo;idle&rdquo;
processes. The pages used can be &ldquo;swapped&rdquo; from RAM to Disk - freeing up low-latency space for active processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would highly recommend reading <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, Ch 18</a>
if you want to learn more about paging. It is a thorough explanation.</p>
<h3 id="caches">Caches</h3>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://screamingpigeon.github.io/projects/ooo_pt1">this entry</a>, low-latency memory is very expensive to
fab write into the die of the CPU. As such - there usually exists a memory hierarchy like</p>
<pre><code>Registers --&gt; L1 Cache --&gt; L2 Cache --&gt; L3 Cache --&gt; (DD)RAM --&gt; Disk(HDD/SSD)
</code></pre>
<p>Going from left to right, memory becomes cheaper but also slower.</p>
<p>A modern day CPU contains several cores. Usually - the first 3 stages of the memory hierarchy is per-core, with the
Last Level Cache (LLC) being shared between all the cores. My work computer (the one I am currently typing this post on XD),
has a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/201897/intel-core-i710850h-processor-12m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html#specs-1-0-2">Intel i7 10850H</a>
which has a 12 MB smart-cache. I assume almost all of its size comes from the LLC.</p>
<h3 id="tlb-and-cache-paging-interactions">TLB and Cache-Paging Interactions</h3>
<p>Classic x86 utilized a hardware structure known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">Translation Lookaside Buffer</a>
(TLB). This was essentially a fully-associative cache that held the mappings between virtual and physical memory addresses. When
changing the address-space - the TLB was modified to reflect the new mapping.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about it - All the loads and stores usually happen from/to the L1 Cache. How are the Cache and TLB
synchronized with each other. This is a completely valid concern -  does the cache use physical addresses, or
virtual addresses. What happens if there is an address-space switch? Do we flush the entire cache?</p>
<p>There are 3 basic schemes of Cache-TLB coherency known as:</p>
<ol>
<li>PIPT - Physically Indexed Physically Tagged</li>
<li>VIVT - Virtually Indexed Virtually Tagged</li>
<li>VIPT - Virtually Indexed Physically Tagged</li>
</ol>
<p>Usuaully VIPT is the more robust scheme. Intel tends to use this scheme in its caches. If you are curious about how
these schemes work and why VIPT has benefits, <a href="https://view.officeapps.livehttps://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fcourses.physics.illinois.edu%2Fece411%2Ffa2022%2Fslides%2Flect08_l.pptx.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fcourses.physics.illinois.edu%2Fece411%2Ffa2022%2Fslides%2Flect08_l.pptx">these slides</a>
do a pretty good job (I found these after a quick google search).</p>
<p><strong>Section 2 of the Flush + Reload</strong> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2671225.2671271">paper</a> also explains the prerequisite
concepts needed to understand how the attack works.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-flush-reload-work">How does Flush Reload work?</h2>
<p>Flush + Reload works on x86 systems, and can run on the same or different core than the target process - effectively running in parallel.
It also operates by manipulating pages that are shared by both the target and the attacker.</p>
<p>The attack consists of 3 phases - <strong>flush</strong>, <strong>wait</strong>, and <strong>reload</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flush</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>The monitored cacheline containing the shared page is flushed from the memory hierarchy. This is done with the
<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/clflush"><code>clflush</code></a> instruction. This instruction basically takes an
address, and flushes any cacheline containing said address from all 3 caches.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Reload</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>The attacker waits for some unspecified amount of time.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Reload</strong>:
The attacker attempts accessing, or &ldquo;reloading&rdquo; the address it just flushed from the hierarchy. The amount of time
it takes for this load to execute is measured.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on how long the reload takes - it is possible to infer if the target process accessed that cacheline. A short
reload time implies that the data was reloaded by the target into the shared LLC,
and just needs to be loaded into CPU-specific caches (L1 and/or L2). A long reload time implies that the cacheline
was not loaded by the target, as it includes the delay of fetching a line from RAM to the LLC.</p>
<p>The target&rsquo;s access of this cacheline is independent of the attacker process. This means that a long wait time can help
guaruntee a fast reload - but it reduces the temporal resolution of the attack.</p>
<p>The paper mentions that an approach to improve attack granularity is to target looped executions in the target program.
The repeated accesses can allow for a small wait phase - allowing the attacker to sample memory at a higher rate.</p>
<p>The actual &ldquo;attack&rdquo; part of this exploit runs off of statistical analysis of the delay times for different cachelines -
which can be used to infer program state for popular open-source programs, like GPG (Gnu&rsquo;s Privacy Guard) - an opensource
security library that implemnts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem">RSA</a> encryption.</p>
<h3 id="inferring-private-keys">Inferring Private Keys</h3>
<p>Using memory access times to decipher private keys sounded pretty unbelievable when I first read the paper. But it became
intuitive pretty quick.</p>
<p>The algorithm for RSA is well documented. GPG is FOSS and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/gpg/gnupg">source</a> is available to anyone.</p>
<p>It is known that the sequence of operations Square-Reduce-Multiply-Reduce  indicates setting of a <code>1</code> in the
key. The sequence Square-Reduce (S,R) without a multiply (M) next indicates setting of a <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>If the attacker were to constantly flush instructions associated with Square, Reduce, and Multiply,
and then poll load times - it would be so easy to extrapolate what bits are being set in the key!
Low load times for cachelines associated with Square would imply the target did a square operation - and
so on.</p>
<p>This is exactly how flush reload works. Figuring out a sampling rate to get reliable data is hard -
but that&rsquo;s just an implementation problem - we have intuition on our side now.</p>
<p>In fact, overcoming the implementation details of this attack would appear to be the hard part.</p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OOO Execution:
Modern Processors are not designed to run instructions in order. The CPU will try to schedule instructions in a different order
(or parallely) than what the original programmer intended. The authors of this attack utilize the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mfence">lfence</a>
and <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/lfence">mfence</a> instructions to force the CPU to serially run the program.</p>
<p><code>mfence</code> forces the CPU to wait for all preceding loads <strong>and</strong> stores to complete before proceeding. <code>lfence</code> forces the CPU to wait for all
preceding loads to complete before proceeding. This allows the code used to &ldquo;probe&rdquo; reload time to be unaffected by other sections of the attacker&rsquo;s
program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASLR: also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">Address Space Layour Randomization</a> is used by the Linux kernel
to &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; how the memory needed by a process is loaded into memory. It moves around the position of the stack, heap, and executable sections to make
it hard for attackers to figure out what memory address to target. <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt">This</a> is a really good example of how
ASLR helps.</p>
<p>In our case, <code>libcrypt.so</code> is a shared page, so both processes relies on the same ASLR mapping. However! The LLC on Intel uses a VIPT scheme.</p>
<p>In a VIPT scheme - the lower bits of a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; address are used to index into the cache. The upper bits of the physical address are used to &lsquo;validate&rsquo;
that the address hit is correct (validated against the TLB). However! If the page offset bits for paging equal the number of index/offset bits in the cache -
the &ldquo;tag&rdquo; will be the same as physical address.The offset/index bits don&rsquo;t matter since they are the same for both virtual and physical addresses.
Thus you only need to know the physical address, i.e, the &ldquo;tag&rdquo; and you can identify the page that needs targetting.</p>
<p>This is why ASLR fails to impede the attacker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context Switches</p>
<p>A big benefit of Operating-Systems is the isolation of processes. On a system with multiple processes, context-switches happen constantly.
On a system with more threads than CPUs, concurrency allows threads to &ldquo;time-slice&rdquo; on the CPU. Additionally, the kernel may interrupt threads
to perform system activity. All of these may cause discrepancies leading to the attacker unable to sample at regular periods, and for the target&rsquo;s
accesses to instructions in (S, R, M) to become sporadic - causing capture errors.</p>
<p>The authors reported that a manual inspection of probe times can reduce such errors by 25-50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speculative Execution and Prefetching</p>
<p>In addition to OOO execution - processors execute branches speculatively - i.e evaulate both branches and only commit the correct one.
They also tend to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_prefetching">prefetchers</a> that may preemptively reload cachelines to
boost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_memory_access_time">AMAT</a>. This may cause low probe times despite the processor not executing
SRM operations.</p>
<p>The authors recommended avoiding probing lines at the start of the SRM functions to reduce the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; introduced by speculative execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization</p>
<p>So far, we have discussed &ldquo;content-aware page sharing&rdquo;, where identical pages are identified using disk location and then shared by processes in memory.
Modern servers use several layers of virtualization - including VMs and Hypervisors - which use &ldquo;content-based page sharing&rdquo;. This technique
offers higher memory efficiency, as a result of a more aggressive sharing mechanism. The system scans memory, and basically merges unrelated pages
with the same contents.</p>
<p>TODO: Decide if this is worth mentioning as a con</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="thoughts-on-the-attack">Thoughts on the attack</h3>
<p>This is pretty cool tbh. I can&rsquo;t think of a HW solution that fixes this problem. The only fix I could think of is disabling cache flushing in the LLC. I am
not sure how many important programs rely on <code>cflush</code> - and it would fix the problem immediately.</p>
<p>The authors mention <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf">&ldquo;constant-time exponentiation&rdquo;</a> as another solution. If I recall correctly, this has become the
norm after vulnerabilities like Flush Reload were discovered.</p>
<h1 id="my-demo">My Demo</h1>
<p>Now for the fun part - trying to implement this. I have only briefly loked at the program for <code>flush()</code> and <code>probe()</code>, and the execution frequency for these.
I am hopeful that I can (somewhat) authentically develop the attack, with iterative improvements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a minute since I have written x86 assembly. After refreshing my memory on <a href="http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/view/a-brief-tutorial-on-gcc-inline-asm">writing inline assembly</a>
, I got started</p>
