      <description>Intro Last November, I got the chance to meet Daniel Genkin - at the Midwest Security Workshop. He is one of the authors/discoveres of SPECTRE and MELTDOWN , some of the most critical vulnerabilities discovered in the last decade. These were also unpatchable due to them being hardware vulnerabilities.&#xA;Bumping into Daniel was a happy coincidence for me. I was aware that MSW had a section on HW Security (which is why I went in the first place) - but I never knew that such an epic security researcher was going to be there.</description>
