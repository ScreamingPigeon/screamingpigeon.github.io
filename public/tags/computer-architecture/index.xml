      <description>Intro Last November, I got the chance to meet Daniel Genkin - at the Midwest Security Workshop. He is one of the authors/discoveres of SPECTRE and MELTDOWN , some of the most critical vulnerabilities discovered in the last decade. These were also unpatchable due to them being hardware vulnerabilities.&#xA;Bumping into Daniel was a happy coincidence for me. I was aware that MSW had a section on HW Security (which is why I went in the first place) - but I never knew that such an epic security researcher was going to be there.</description>

      <description>This post is about 5 months late. I created the markdown file on 12/23/2025 but never got around to writing anything to it. Now, I have some time on my hands (and I feel bad about not writing as often as I had planned to) - so I figured I will give this a shot again.&#xA;Last fall, I took ECE 411 the infamous computer-architecture class at my university. This was a class I was really looking forward to.</description>
