      <description>This post is about 5 months late. I created the markdown file on 12/23/2025 but never got around to writing anything to it. Now, I have some time on my hands (and I feel bad about not writing as often as I had planned to) - so I figured I will give this a shot again.&#xA;Last fall, I took ECE 411 the infamous computer-architecture class at my university. This was a class I was really looking forward to.</description>
